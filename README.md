# Projects Overview
**Task 01 - [Movie Genre Classification]**
In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary and other textual information. The workflow included text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The goal was to transform raw movie plot text into meaningful numerical features and apply supervised learning to classify each plot into one or more genres.This task demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in real-world classification problems.
Example: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.

**Task 02 â€“ [CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION]**
In this task, I built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing anonymized transaction features. The objective was to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, addressing the common challenge of class imbalance in fraud detection.

The workflow involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on minimizing false negatives in fraud detection.

This project highlights the application of supervised learning in a critical, real-world financial security scenario.
Example: Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions..

**Task 03 â€“ [CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION]**
In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data. The dataset included features such as usage behavior, demographics, and account activity, which were used to identify patterns associated with customer retention and churn.

After preprocessing the data and performing exploratory analysis, I trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. The goal was to build a model that can accurately flag customers likely to churn, helping businesses take proactive steps to improve retention.

This project demonstrates the use of predictive analytics in solving real-world business problems through classification techniques..
Example: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business..

**Task 04 â€“ [SPAM SMS DETECTION]**
In this task, I built a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. The dataset contained labeled text messages, which were preprocessed and transformed using TF-IDF to extract meaningful features from the text.

I experimented with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately detect spam. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, with a focus on minimizing false positives.

This project showcases the use of natural language processing (NLP) and text classification techniques for automating spam detection in communication systems..
Example: Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

**Task 05 â€“ [HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION]**
In this task, I implemented a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. The model was trained on a dataset of handwritten text samples, learning the sequential patterns of characters at the pixel or stroke level.

The RNN captures the temporal dependencies between characters, enabling it to generate new text sequences that mimic the style and structure of natural handwriting. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for sequence modeling and generative tasks in the domain of handwriting synthesis.

Key techniques include sequence modeling, RNN architecture (e.g., LSTM/GRU), and text generation based on learned patterns..
Example: Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to
generate handwritten-like text..
